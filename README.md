## Assignment 1 Stochastic Simmulation course UVA november 2024 
This code belongs to the paper titled "Estimating the Area of the Mandelbrot set", which aims to provide insights into Monte Carlo integration methods. We take the Mandelbrot set and try to define its true size. We use different sampling methods in order to reduce variance in outcomes and speed up convergence. Our results highlight the features of each method, providing insights for their application in stochastic simulation.

## Dependencies 
numpy

scipy
tqdm
## Usage instructions 
Code for making the runs is included, but so is data from previous runs (.pkl files). Re-running will take considerate amount of time, therefore, using data from the pickle files is recommended.
